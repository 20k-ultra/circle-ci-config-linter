Add a lint errors badge on your repos [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) config. You can learn more about CircleCI config options at [docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/).

Replace {{YOUR-REPOSITORY}} to your profile or org and repository name.

Repo without CircleCI config

### Building

```bash
$ lein install
$ lein test
```

### To do

- allow for passing parameter so that details about errors are returned instead of an SVG.
- add more button styles (See [shields.io](https://shields.io))
- add CircleCI AWS [CLI](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-cli) or [Serverless](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-sam-serverless) Orbs to automatically deploy builds

### Mentions

- [Schemastore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/)
- [json-schema.clj](https://github.com/niquola/json-schema.clj)

The Schemastore spec used for this can be found in [/resources/circle-ci-schema.json](https://github.com/20k-ultra/circle-ci-config-linter/blob/master/resources/circle-ci-schema.json). I had to modify it slightly because the original was causing json-schema.clj to throw some errors.
