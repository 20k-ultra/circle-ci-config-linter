# circle-ci-config-linter

Lint a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) config file from a github repository. You can learn more about CircleCI config options at [docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/).

### Building

```bash
$ lein install
$ lein test
```

### Usage

The following command will ouput an SVG to sdout. You can save this in a file to be used later but the plan is to host this as a service on AWS Lambda so any repository can lint their configs!

```bash
$ lein run "CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli"
```

### To do

- make this run on Lambda with [lambada](https://github.com/uswitch/lambada)
- add more button styles (See [shields.io](https://shields.io))

### Built with

This tool was made possible because of:

- [Schemastore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/)
- [json-schema.clj](https://github.com/niquola/json-schema.clj)

The Schemastore spec used for this can be found in [/resources/circle-ci-schema.json](https://github.com/20k-ultra/circle-ci-config-linter/blob/master/resources/circle-ci-schema.json). I had to modify it slightly because the original was causing json-schema.clj to throw some errors.
